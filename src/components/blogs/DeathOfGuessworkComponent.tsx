          How It Works: From Idea to Validated Wireframes in Minutes
        </h2>
        <div className="text-white text-lg font-normal leading-[26px] w-[925px] mt-9 max-md:max-w-full">
          <span className="font-semibold">
            Step 1: Define What You're Building
          </span>
          <br />
          Start by describing, in a few words, what you want to accomplish
          (e.g., "Create a streamlined onboarding flow for new users").
          Featurely translates this into Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBDs), which you can
          refine to ensure alignment with your goals.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span className="font-semibold">
            Step 2: Generate an Initial Wireframe
          </span>
          <br />
          Once the JTBDs are set, Featurely automatically generates a wireframe
          based on best practices and expected user behavior. Alternatively, you
          can upload your own wireframe or provide a staging link for an
          existing prototype.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span className="font-semibold">
            Step 3: Define Your Target Persona
          </span>
          <br />
          AI-powered usability tests are most effective when tailored to
          specific user personas. Featurely enables you to define key attributes
          of your target audience—such as demographics and behavior patterns —to
          ensure realistic testing.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span className="font-semibold">
            Step 4: AI-Driven Usability Testing
          </span>
          <br />
          Featurely runs AI-driven usability tests by simulating real user
          interactions using advanced behavioral modeling techniques. AI agents
          mimic real user actions, identifying:
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>Where users struggle or get confused</li>
            <li>Drop-off points in the user journey</li>
            <li>Opportunities to enhance navigation and engagement</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <span className="font-semibold">
            Step 5: Generate a Validated Wireframe
          </span>
          <br />
          Based on usability test results, Featurely refines the wireframe,
          producing a data-backed, optimized design that eliminates friction and
          aligns with how users actually interact with your product.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span className="font-semibold">
            Step 6: Iterate & Build with Confidence
          </span>
          <br />
          Use the validated wireframe as a foundation for development, reducing
          the need for multiple iteration cycles and ensuring a seamless user
          experience from the start.
          <br />
          <br />
          Featurely enables product builders to replace guesswork with science
          by using real-time behavior modeling to inform UX decisions.

          How Predictive UX Research Improves Product Development
        </h2>
        <div className="text-white text-lg font-semibold leading-[26px] w-[925px] mt-9 max-md:max-w-full">
          1. Reducing Costly Iterations
          <br />
          <span className="font-normal">
            Many teams spend months iterating on features that fail to meet user
            needs. Predictive UX modelling ensures that the first iteration is
            closer to the right answer, reducing wasted development cycles.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span className="font-normal">
            Example: Instead of launching a new checkout flow and waiting for
            weeks of A/B test results, predictive models can anticipate drop-off
            points and user confusion before implementation.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          2. Identifying UX Bottlenecks Early
          <br />
          <span className="font-normal">
            Predictive modelling reveals where users are likely to face
            friction—before the design is finalised. This allows teams to
            proactively address usability issues, rather than reactively fixing
            them post-launch.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span className="font-normal">
            Example: If a dashboard is too complex, behavioural insights can
            indicate where users will get overwhelmed, allowing for a simpler,
            more intuitive design from the start.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          3. Faster Time-to-Market
          <br />
          <span className="font-normal">
            By eliminating trial-and-error development, teams can launch
            products faster with more confidence, reducing the time spent on
            user testing, redesigns, and feature rollbacks.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span className="font-normal">
            Example: A startup validating a new onboarding flow can get
            data-backed insights within days, instead of running months of
            qualitative tests.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          4. Enhancing Product-Market Fit (PMF)
          <br />
          <span className="font-normal">
            Instead of relying on assumptions about what users want, predictive
            behaviour modelling provides data-driven feature prioritisation.
            This helps teams invest in the right features that resonate with
            their target audience.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span className="font-normal">
            Example: A fintech app looking to optimise its loan application
            process can use predictive UX insights to determine which steps
            cause the most friction and need simplification.

          The shift toward AI-powered UX research and behavioural modelling is

        <div className="text-white text-lg font-normal leading-[26px] w-[925px] mt-9 max-md:max-w-full">
          The days of relying on guesswork, gut feelings, and post-launch
          corrections are coming to an end. With predictive user behavior
          modeling, product teams can: <br />
          <br />✅ Launch the right features faster
          <br />✅ Reduce iteration costs
          <br />✅ Improve UX before development begins
          <br />✅ Achieve product-market fit more efficiently
