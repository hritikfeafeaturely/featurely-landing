            How Predictive UX Research Improves Product Development
          </h2>
          <div className="text-white text-lg leading-7 space-y-4">
            <p className="font-semibold">1. Reducing Costly Iterations</p>
            <p>
              Many teams spend months iterating on features that fail to meet user
              needs. Predictive UX modelling ensures that the first iteration is
              closer to the right answer, reducing wasted development cycles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Example: Instead of launching a new checkout flow and waiting for
              weeks of A/B test results, predictive models can anticipate drop-off
              points and user confusion before implementation.
            </p>

            <p className="font-semibold">2. Identifying UX Bottlenecks Early</p>
            <p>
              Predictive modelling reveals where users are likely to face
              friction—before the design is finalised. This allows teams to
              proactively address usability issues, rather than reactively fixing
              them post-launch.
            </p>
            <p>
              Example: If a dashboard is too complex, behavioural insights can
              indicate where users will get overwhelmed, allowing for a simpler,
              more intuitive design from the start.
            </p>

            <p className="font-semibold">3. Faster Time-to-Market</p>
            <p>
              By eliminating trial-and-error development, teams can launch
              products faster with more confidence, reducing the time spent on
              user testing, redesigns, and feature rollbacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Example: A startup validating a new onboarding flow can get
              data-backed insights within days, instead of running months of
              qualitative tests.
            </p>

            <p className="font-semibold">4. Enhancing Product-Market Fit (PMF)</p>
            <p>
              Instead of relying on assumptions about what users want, predictive
              behaviour modelling provides data-driven feature prioritisation.
              This helps teams invest in the right features that resonate with
              their target audience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Example: A fintech app looking to optimise its loan application
              process can use predictive UX insights to determine which steps
              cause the most friction and need simplification.
