          {`Building a successful product is hard. Despite best efforts, 95% of
          new products fail. There's no single reason why products
          failâ€”sometimes it's bad timing, sometimes poor execution, and
          sometimes market needs shift unexpectedly. But one major contributor
          to failure is not doing user research before the product is built.
          Yet, for many product builders, conducting proper UX research (UXR) is
          easier said than done. As a result, many teams skip UX research or
          delay it until after launch, leading to costly iterations and lost
          users. Let's examine why this happens, its impact on the product, and
          how the right approach can help teams avoid these pitfalls.`}
